Nucleo.js
=========

Nucleo is a WebGL library created with the purpose of accelerating the development of 3D apps on the web.

The two main goals are:

1. A clear architecture: classes must be well differentiated with very clearly defined responsibilities.
2. Ease of use: the grammar and syntax must make be simple and make sense.
